The generative AI revolution has arrived with limitless opportunities to streamline tasks, improve performance, and deliver excellent customer experiences. We've seen early successes with code generation, customer service automation, sales summaries, and more - yet we're just getting started.

Key success drivers of enterprise AI are emerging led by trust, including data security, data privacy, and safety and ethical guardrails. Next is the need to focus on the highestimpact use cases that address bottlenecks, pain points, and performance improvement opportunities. Turnkey AI use cases are the fastest, lowest-risk path to accelerate time to value, test, and validate initial automation opportunities.

Data is the backbone of every AI strategy and key to unlocking the full potential of enterprise AI. Much of this data already exists in a company's CRM. As companies look to achieve more mature use cases, they can pivot from using CRM data to unlocking trapped data across the enterprise. That's when it becomes imperative to enact a strategy that federates and harmonizes data across applications, as many customers are now doing with Salesforce's Data Cloud.

Finally, the unprecedented pace of change in AI requires companies to upskill their entire workforce. This is not a "one-and-done" exercise, but rather a continuous cycle of learning as AI evolves. At Salesforce, we are committed to helping companies empower their teams to stay ahead of the curve with our AI courses and certifications on the Trailhead learning platform.

Looking ahead, we are on the cusp of an even bigger step change. We are quickly moving beyond generation, summarization, and analysis capabilities toward agentic AI, which will perform higher-order planning, reasoning, and orchestration with greater autonomy. We also see the emerging promise of smaller, domain-specific models that balance accuracy with cost and compute power.

In this report, you will find the latest insights on how businesses are approaching AI and moving up the enterprise AI maturity curve to unlock transformational results.

## Executive Summary

## Introduction: Businesses Race to Harness AI's Growing Potential

The role of AI across industries - and society as a whole - is forecasted to grow exponentially in just a few short years. IDC estimates that companies invested $16B in generative AI solutions in 2023, and that they'll invest $140B in 2027 -  a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 70%.

01

## Trust Is Job Number One as Customers Evaluate AI

Consumers are increasingly making AI part of their everyday lives, but are approaching the technology with mixed emotions that call for a foundation of trust and transparency. Seventy-four percent of the general population is concerned about the unethical use of AI, and 63% is concerned about its biases.

## Businesses Evaluate Their Data Foundations 02

AI needs great data to meet its potential. The technology's rise is prompting companies to evaluate the quality, timeliness, and security of their data. Eighty-six percent of technical decision-makers agree that AI's outputs are only as good as its data inputs.

## AI Use Cases Take Shape Across the Enterprise

Whether generating content and communications or optimizing processes, teams are discovering the best ways to incorporate AI in the flow of their work as investments ramp up. No fewer than 92% of sales, service, marketing, or commerce teams are at least considering AI investments.

## Workplace Skills and Policies Are Evolving for the AI Era

Employees recognize the transformative impact of AI on their careers, but their employers are largely falling behind on empowering them for success. Fifty-six percent of desk workers believe generative AI will transform their roles, but only 21% say their company has provided clear policies around its use.

## Introduction

Businesses Race to Harness AI's Growing Potential

<!-- image -->

## Digital Natives Lead AI Adoption

Since the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022, society has been captivated by the power of generative AI and much discussion has been made of its impacts on business and everyday life.

As of late 2023, roughly half of the general population - every company's end customers or user base - has at least tried generative AI, with a plurality considering themselves regular users.

As is often the case with new technology, younger generations are more likely to embrace AI. A whopping seven in 10 Gen Zers use generative AI, and over six in 10 millennials (63%).

52% of generative AI users say they're use of the technology is increasing. 1

## AI's Impact Is Only Beginning

AI is a tectonic shift that is already having a major impact on business, which will only grow by orders of magnitude over the coming years. IDC forecasts that the revenue impact of AI-powered cloud solutions will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2022 and 2027, and that investment by companies in generative AI solutions will have a 70% CAGR between 2023 and 2028.  1

Such technological upheavals come swiftly and can very easily leave those that don't keep pace at a competitive disadvantage. Like those that came before them and failed to adapt to the Internet Age or the cloud computing revolution, many business leaders are already worried that they could be missing out.

## Workers Foresee Transformative Effects

Seventy-two percent of generative AI users are employed - a significantly larger portion than the U.S. labor participation rate of 62%. 1, 2  Thus, the implications for businesses across sectors are hard to understate.

## 56% of desk workers believe generative AI will transform their roles. 2

AI is well on its way to being a hallmark of workflows. As of January 2024, one in four desk workers said they've tried AI tools at work - a 24% acceleration over the one in five who said the same just four months earlier. Eighty percent of those who used AI at work said it improved their productivity, a significant accomplishment given that desk workers spend an estimated 41% of their time on low-value, repetitive tasks that lack meaningful contribution to their core jobs. 3

## Society Enters the AI Era with Mixed Emotions

Curiosity underpins the general population's view of generative AI, with younger generations, in particular, feeling generally excited and hopeful about the technology.

However, all generations - particularly Baby boomers and Gen X - feel at least a tinge of suspicion and anxiety. Baby boomers even cite fear as a top emotion around the rise of AI.

There's no shortage of warnings from experts and observers alike on how the AI revolution could bring about negative consequences. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, remarked in congressional testimony that 'If this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong.' At the same time, there is much discussion about how AI could help make progress on daunting societal challenges like disease, hunger, and climate change, leading to an unsettled attitude around how the technology's impact will unfold.

## The Rise of AI Raises Questions of Trust

Businesses were already facing a crisis of trust before generative AI tools reached the mass market, and their rollout makes the pursuit of customer trust all the more urgent.

## 68% of the general population believes advances in AI make a company's trustworthiness more important. 1

Take, for example, that 74% of the general population is concerned about the unethical use of AI, and 63% are concerned about its biases. Whatsmore, generative AI's usefulness is still unproven among the general public - a mere 10% fully trust it to help them make informed decisions.

01

## Responsible and Transparent AI Earns Customer Trust

Companies looking to implement AI in their operations will be well-served by being transparent in their use of AI, its benefits, and the data sets used to train it.

Other significant drivers of customer trust in AI include validating outputs prior to releasing them for broader consumption and providing customers more control over how and to what extent they interact with the technology.

Companies also have the onus of demonstrating how the data underpinning their AI models is safeguarded: Sixty-four percent of the general population would try generative AI - or use it more often if they believed it were more secure. 2

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Spotlight: Expert Perspective on Ethics

## What ethical concerns are you hearing when it comes to generative AI?

As an enterprise AI company, the risks we focus on are accuracy, bias, toxicity, safety, and privacy. And we're not alone with these ethical concerns - the public, our customers, and regulators are paying very close attention as AI technologies rapidly progress.

## What risks specific to customer data do you foresee coming from generative AI?

At Salesforce, we take a three-pronged approach to mitigating these risks. First, by ensuring model safety and privacy. Second, we build trusted feature designs and architecture. And finally, implementing policy and use case safeguards. This includes carefully choosing what data we use to train our AI, red-teaming and assessing bias and toxicity before they impact customers, and building risk mitigations directly into our generative AI technologies. We're designing our AI systems with guardrails and protections that empower humans at the helm of AI, including confidence scores, prompt engineering, safety filters, citations and explanations.

<!-- image -->

## What can companies to do prepare?

It's always been important to collect quality data and ensure transparency and consent in the collection process. But it's not just about taking data in. It's also about what happens to that data once we have it. We protect the people whose information enables our AI models by ensuring their data is never left in a repository that can be easily breached or misused. The Einstein Trust Layer safeguards your company data, in addition to our internal policies and external agreements, so that companies can reap the benefits of AI with none of the risks. Companies may need data as much as ever, but the best thing they can do to protect customers is to build methodologies that prioritize keeping that data - and their customers' trust - safe.

## AI Exposes Enterprise Data's Shortcomings

'Garbage in, garbage out' has been a longstanding mantra among data and analytics practitioners, but it's never been more true than now in the age of large language models (LLMs).

## 86% of analytics and IT leaders agree AI's outputs are only as good as its data inputs, and 87% agree AI's rise makes data management a higher priority. 1

A lack of trusted data within organizations is posing a significant hurdle for those seeking to use AI, even as their employees embrace it. In fact, over half of workplace AI users say it's difficult to get what they need out of the technology, and nearly as many say they don't trust the data that underpins it in the first place. A related study found that these sentiments are more common among line-of-business leaders than their technical counterparts. 1

## Data Strategies Remain Rare as Complexity - and Scrutiny - Intensifies

Workers cite data accuracy (82%), data security (82%), and data completeness (78%) as critical for building their trust in AI, and most say the same for AI trained on their company's unique and relevant insights.

## 53% of workers say training AI on comprehensive customer/company data builds their trust in the technology.

But powering AI with comprehensive, high-quality company or customer data is easier said than done given the state of enterprise data. Fifty-nine percent of organizations lack a unified data strategy . 1

The task is not getting simpler. Firms expect the volume of their data to increase by 23% annually, 1  on average, spread across an average of 991 apps. 2

## Data Maturity Signals AI Preparedness

Data maturity is a building block of successful AI adoption, with highmaturity organizations citing superior infrastructure, strategy, and alignment compared to low-data-maturity organizations.*

Differences between high- and lowmaturity companies are stark when it comes to data quality, completeness, and overall strategy.

High-maturity respondents are 2x more likely than lowmaturity respondents to have the high-quality data needed to use AI effectively. 1

## Spotlight: AI Models, Data, and the Build-Vs-Buy Conundrum

Companies, especially large enterprises, are increasingly taking an 'all of the above' approach to selecting AI models. Four out of five enterprise IT leaders with AI say they're already using multiple models, and nearly seven in 10 (69%) expect to increase the number of models they use over coming years. 1  As companies move to deploy generative AI, they need to choose LLMs that best fit their use cases.

## Enterprise AI Is Increasingly a Multiple Model Endeavor

LLMs come in two primary flavors: Pre-trained versions like OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini, which are used "off-the-shelf," and open-source versions like Meta's LLaMA, which users can customize to suit specific needs. Each version has its pros and cons regarding cost, supported modalities, technical expertise needed, data security, and other factors.

New tactics like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), in which a vector database with institutional data is securely paired with a foundational LLM, are emerging to help companies make better use of both structured and unstructured data to power AI. A recent 451 Research study found that 87% of IT leaders view this strategy positively. 2

## AI in Customer Service

Service teams are at the forefront of AI enterprise AI adoption, having for years implemented solutions such as chatbots and call routing. Yet agents still spend an average of 39% of their time working with customers, with the balance of working hours spent on administrative duties and other rote tasks, signaling that the technology's role will continue to grow. 1

## 84% of service teams expect increased AI investment over the next year. 1

Like other departments, service teams are concerned about security risks that AI may introduce, but are also particularly concerned about a the contextual knowledge many LLMs may lack about their business and customers. Service teams are also aware of the risk of dehumanization from AI - a testament to the importance of keeping actual humans at the forefront of customer relationships.

## Training and Re-skilling Enter the Spotlight

Despite understandable concern about negative impacts from AI on employment, a model from IDC projects a significant increase in jobs from AI over the coming years.

## A net gain of 11.6M jobs from AI-powered cloud solutions is expected between 2022 and 2028. 1

Yet much like when computers replaced typewriters in the previous century, transitioning workforce skills to the AI age will take effort from employees and employers alike. Today, 62% of desk workers don't believe they have the skills to effectively and safely use generative AI, and 53% say they don't know how to extract the most value from it. 3

## 41% say they'd consider overstating their AI skills to secure an opportunity. 3

## Employees Go Rogue in the Absence of Policies

It's unsurprising that AI training is falling behind adoption, given the majority of companies haven't articulated to employees whether or how AI can be used in the first place.

Desk workers rank companyapproved tools/programs as the top factor for effective and safe use of generative AI, but only 21% say their company has provided such policies. 1

Workers aren't waiting for their employers to define protocols around the use of generative AI. Instead, many are diving right in, despite the absence of policies and approved tools, introducing a new wave of shadow IT that introduces data security and ethical questions.

## Spotlight: Expert Perspective on AI Guidelines for Employees

## Is 'should we use AI' the right question for leaders to ask at this point?

The truth is, employees are likely going to use AI in some fashion, regardless of whether or not they have permission. A more relevant question is whether businesses are fostering an innovative culture where employees are empowered and encouraged to safely explore within clear boundaries. As you integrate AI into your workplace as a productivity tool, consider and reconsider (as the tools evolve) guidelines and guardrails that promote creative experimentation, while mitigating known or developing risks.

## How should enterprises approach creating guidelines for AI usage for employees?

Don't let your employees wander unprotected through the forest of pop-up AI tools. Build out your internal AI protocols to safely supply

<!-- image -->

employees with AI tools and limit usage of third-party tools by implementing restrictions to ensure data privacy and security. It's also important to emphasize the instances where AI should absolutely not be utilized - such as for giving legal, financial, or medical advice.

## How will leaders know if their policies are working?

Given the rapid evolution of the landscape, enterprises should view their  policies as  living documents and plan to review and update them regularly. Empower leaders with robust reporting mechanisms to enable transparency and swift issue resolution of AI-related concerns as well as corrective iteration where things go awry. Using an AI tool can be a great first step, but AI is not a substitute for  human judgment. Create a culture that encourages employees to critically evaluate and refine outputs to ensure AI augments rather than shortcuts human judgment.
