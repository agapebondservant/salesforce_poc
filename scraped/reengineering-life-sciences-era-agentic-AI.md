## A New Era in Life Sciences

The life sciences industry is looking toward a future of innovation and better patient outcomes. At the same time, it is navigating unprecedented changes in the marketplace. Frank Defesche, Salesforce SVP and GM of Life Sciences Cloud, explains, 'Life sciences is facing unprecedented change fueled by the evolving needs of patients and HCPs (healthcare professionals), emerging industry trends and operating models, increased complexity of treatments, new data sets, and technology advancements spurred by AI across clinical, medical, and commercial functions.'

As the industry continues to expand, so do the regulatory and compliance issues it needs to address. In addition, an increased focus on advanced therapeutic modalities (ATMs) is driving a need for more complex capabilities to support the future of research and development and manufacturing. The evolving societal need to advance health equity is also driving life sciences organizations to invest in initiatives that can help them design better customer engagement programs and have a positive impact on patient outcomes.

## AI: Changing the Way Life Sciences Does Business

The impact of predictive intelligence, generative AI (GenAI), and now agentic AI on the industry is undeniable, with applications in drug discovery, clinical trials, manufacturing, inventory and logistics already changing the game. A recent survey by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions found that 66% of biopharma and medtech companies are experimenting with AI to test ideas and build use cases. The Deloitte research explains organizations 'are exploring ways the technology could automate repetitive back-office functions, reimagine supply chains, or support compliance and regulatory affairs.' 1

One key area in which AI promises to impact life sciences is in the redefinition of marketing excellence. In a marketplace in which customer needs are ever-evolving, AI can help life sciences companies engage customers with hyper-personalized and contextualized content at scale - and with agility and speed via multiple channels. In this way, they will be able to reach customers with relevant content when and where they need it. 2

Is the industry ready to unleash all this power? At least a couple of concerns and challenges remain.

## Potential Outcomes Enabled by AI

| Data                 | AI-enabled data classification, extraction, and integration that of a robust, scalable data fabric                                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insights             | Generate rich insights about customer behavior, personas, and customer needs from large volumes of interaction data to inform engagement choices             |
| Brand strategy       | Real-time competitive, market, and customer intelligence from public sources to inform and continuously refresh brand strategy                               |
| Content development  | Efficiency, scale, and velocity plays enabled by automated content tagging, content generation, and hyper-personalization                                    |
| Precision engagement | Amplify next-best engagement throughout the customer life cycle, from on- boarding to retention, by providing always-on experiences at scale                 |
| Measurement          | Enable precise, granular measurement of campaign effectiveness at the content attribute level by overcoming barriers to scale associated with manual tagging |

## The Data Readiness Gap

While organizations recognize the importance of data readiness for successful AI implementation, many still face significant hurdles in this area. While life sciences companies have vast amounts of data sources, many are finding it a challenge to unify customer data sources and put AI to work creating consistent, personalized experiences across the customer journey.

Many continue to be challenged by fractured data environments, with data stuck in silos or data that is unstructured or not adhering to metadata standards-a scenario that can limit an organization's ability to benefit from AI. A recent survey of experts from pharma, technology, and regulatory conducted by the Pistoia Alliance found that 58% of respondents cited low-quality and poorly curated datasets as the top barrier to successful AI implementation, with 34% saying that privacy and security concerns around data also represented a challenge. 3

Life sciences organizations need a way to connect all their data in order to have a consistent, complete, and current view of their patients and HCPs, and to transform stakeholder engagement across areas like clinical participant recruitment and enrollment, AI-generated sales communication, patient and HCP self-service, and intelligent orchestration.

of respondents cited low-quality and poorly curated datasets as the top barrier to successful AI implementation.

of respondents say that privacy and security concerns around data also represented a challenge.

The effective use of AI relies on the ability of precise AI models to train on extensive datasets. That means that companies that wish to harness the power of AI need to establish a data pipeline that can format data from a wide range of sources consistently and store it efficiently.

## Trustworthiness Concerns

Even though the adoption of GenAI by the life sciences industry for a broad menu of use cases is inevitable, concerns remain about the trustworthiness of the technology. The Pistoia survey found that, although 70% of respondents acknowledged the potential of AI, 63% expressed concerns that poor data quality could lead to incorrect conclusions and even potentially harmful clinical decisions.

## Using AI to Update How Life Sciences Organizations Engage with HCPs

With exponential increases in the cost of medical events and education programs for HCPs, it is more important than ever for life sciences companies to look at the ways they engage with HCPs. 'Most life sciences companies will have to update their customer engagement platforms in the next five years,' said David Rosner, Deloitte Consulting Principal. 'That has been driving a lot of activity around determining how to use AI in strategic ways.'

A customer engagement model that includes a mix of traditional and digital channels across all touchpoints is quickly becoming the standard for reaching HCPs with relevant messages at the right time. And it is the model HCPs prefer. They want more personalized content, tailored to their therapeutic area, practical experience, and needs and interests.

We've heard from HCPs about how they would prefer to engage with digital channels. When you think of all the repetitive tasks an HCP needs to do with a pharma company, those are areas we can look at using digital technology. And they welcome it."

Krysten Musich

Salesforce Global Head, Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences Ind. Advisory and Strategy

'We've also heard from HCPs that it matters in the execution of the AI. If it's solving a problem-or helping a MSL (medical science liaison) or field rep be more scalable, they're open to it. It's only when it feels like they're talking to AI that it's frustrating.'

AI can also augment the work of humans in the field. Capabilities like downloading data about HCP activities with the company can assist teams with pre-call planning so they are more empowered to answer questions from HCPs. For medtech companies, AI can help them with tasks like assisting HCPs in instrument selection or surgical planning for implants.

Life sciences companies need to find the right mix of channels for their interactions with HCPs. An omnichannel engagement model-one that tailors interactions to the specific needs of the HCP across multiple channels-is quickly replacing a traditional strategy that relied on push interactions from field representatives as the predominant point of contact with HCPs. It is now important for pharma companies to add a pull component to their engagement strategies, one that enables HCPs to receive the information and resources they need, when they need it.

Driven by advances in AI technology, pharma companies are increasingly moving away from the one-way engagement model and investing in customer relationship management (CRM) and omnichannel platforms.

## Taking Stock of the Current Customer Relationship Landscape

A recent Deloitte survey of more than 240 global HCPs and pharmaceutical executives found a persistent gap between what customers need and what pharma companies are doing. 4

<!-- image -->

More than 80% of pharma executives are satisfied with their current customer engagement strategy. However, less than 35% of HCPs feel like pharma's customer-facing resources are meeting their needs well.

<!-- image -->

Nearly half (47%) of HCPs harbor concerns about the scientific validity of communications from sales representatives and question the authenticity of these resources.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Most (67%) of the time, HCPs prefer to get their information from non-pharma company channels, especially since 37% believe that medical science liaisons are not available when needed and don't offer enough engagement when they are present.

## What Customers Are Saying

Many Salesforce clients in the life sciences industry have shared their plans to accelerate their customer engagement programs as well as some of their top concerns as they consider those investments. Here are some of the trends.

<!-- image -->

## They know that personalization will be the key to providing a superior

customer experience. This has been borne out by Salesforce research, which shows that a significant segment of healthcare and life sciences (HLS) leaders consider AI to be key to enabling a more personalized customer engagement model, with 20% ranking personalized consumer experiences as the #1 important outcome. 5

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

They realize that, even though their sales reps may have access to data, they often lack prioritized, real-time, actionable recommendations. As a result, they are taking deep dives into the potential of AI-powered next best actions (NBAs).

Their definition of the customer is changing. As pharmacies continue to evolve into one-stop shops for health and wellness needs, for example, the need for life sciences companies to develop direct connections to pharmacy customers is greater than ever. Similarly, as patients become more interested and educated in health information, life sciences companies are looking for new ways to engage with patients on multiple channels.

<!-- image -->

Harnessing customer engagement data is a challenge. Even with their vast stores of data, pharma and biotech organizations continue to struggle with building a robust data strategy and extracting value from that data.

The intersection of life sciences and CRM is more important than ever. CRM helps life sciences organizations understand their customers and allows them to make data-driven decisions about how to improve products and enhance customer interactions.

Life Sciences Cloud can streamline clinical trial onboarding with auto-matching and customized portals. This is a critical area in need of improvement. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 80% of trials fail to onboard the required number of patients and must extend their timelines, resulting in delays that can cost as much as $8 million per day in lost revenue for drug development companies. 6

<!-- image -->

This is an area where I see a transformative opportunity with generative AI. AI can help identify and engage with prospective and current clinical trial candidates according to their preferences and location, working to accelerate clinical trials and help create a better overall experience for patients, helping to lower the likelihood of attrition and achieve better outcomes'

Its capabilities will include intelligent content, engagement analytics, and built-in compliance, as well as offline tools that harmonize engagement data, claims, and research to fuel AI and inform personalized interactions with HCPs. This can be used to automate manual tasks like email outreach, suggest documents for medical information requests, and prepare for visits with call planning and e-detailing.

Using Salesforce's advanced reasoning engine powered by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), sales reps can unlock insights previously hidden in emails, meeting notes, call transcripts, scientific publications, product documentation, and more. RAG can take that data from all of those unstructured materials in Data Cloud to facilitate the creation of a meeting brief, helping reps quickly prepare for customer conversations based on all the relevant background information. The Atlas Reasoning Engine, the brain inside the Salesforce tool

Agentforce, autonomously analyzes data, makes decisions, and completes tasks, providing reliable and accurate results. This is what allows Agentforce to act, not just assist. Sales reps can ask an HCP engagement agent, 'Who are my HCPs with declining scripts over the past 6 months?' or 'Which content and key messaging should I be using for this call?'

Agentic AI will streamline inquiry management across channels by auto-generating responses that help get critical information to providers. It will also simplify the benefits verification process, recommend support programs or financial assistance, and orchestrate personalized medicine - all to accelerate approvals to get patients on therapy faster.
