      Our inaugural issue of this magazine focused on possible futures where AI
      agents transform how companies connect with their customers. In this issue,
      we turn to agents in the enterprise and the potential they hold for a
      wholesale reorganization of work. We invite you to envision a workplace
      teeming with nextgeneration copilots, autonomous agents, and augmented
      humans. How does it function? How does it feel for the human employees that
      work in this environment? And what can we all learn from time-traveling
      into such a future that we can bring back to improve the questions we ask
      ourselves today?
      The pace of AI progress offers one clue as to what might be in store. In
      May, OpenAI launched GPT 4-omni, whose multi-modal capabilities and
      flirtatious female voice drew immediate comparisons to the 2013 film Her
      and its omniscient and overly-familiar personal assistant. Here at
      Salesforce, The Einstein Enterprise vision is quickly becoming a reality,
      including the launch of Agentforce, a platform for intelligent agents in
      service, sales, commerce, and beyond.

      At Salesforce Futures, our mission requires us not only to anticipate, but
      also to imagine fleshed-out futures. This allows Salesforce and our
      customers to identify the choices they might need to make to shape their
      own destiny. Amara's law says that we overestimate the impact of
      technological change in the short-term and underestimate it in the long-
      term. When new technologies like generative AI are first introduced, we
      apply them narrowly to existing processes, and their impact can seem
      limited. It's only over a longer time-frame that innovators figure out how
      to use the capabilities of the new tech to redesign larger systems.
      To meet this challenge and bring possible futures to life where AI agents
      are fundamentally changing the shape of work, we use three fictional
      companies. They're at varying stages of AI transformation, and they operate
      differently, due to factors like their age, past strategic choices, and the
      intensity of competition they face. This reflects the reality we see in
      today's business world. For example, while a few organizations are
      aggressively preparing for an agent-driven future, others are just
      beginning their exploration.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the mission of Salesforce Futures?
        answer: The mission of Salesforce Futures is to anticipate and imagine detailed
          futures, enabling Salesforce and its customers to make informed choices
          about their future.
      - question: How does Amara's Law relate to the impact of new technologies like
          generative AI?
        answer: According to Amara's Law, new technologies like generative AI are
          initially underestimated in impact as they are applied narrowly to existing
          processes, but their true impact becomes apparent over a longer time-frame
          when innovators redesign larger systems.
      - question: How does Salesforce Futures illustrate the current business landscape
          regarding AI transformation?
        answer: Salesforce Futures uses three fictional companies at different stages
          of AI transformation to reflect today's business world, where some organizations
          are aggressively preparing for an agent-driven future, while others are
          just starting their exploration.

      In part this is because the challenges AI brings are not only -drawing on
      leadership expert Ronald Heifetz -technical ones, relatively easily defined
      and where expert knowledge exists on how to solve them. Rather, AI is
      generating more fundamental adaptive challenges, ambiguous and difficult to
      define, let alone to think about solving.
      Navigating adaptive challenges requires sophisticated leadership skills,
      and many pitfalls lie in wait along the way. Our storytelling aims to
      bridge the gap in imagination, creating a shared understanding that
      provides a basis for identifying adaptive challenges.
      Tech blogger Byrne Hobart has written of how AI 'places a much higher
      premium on clarity and accuracy in internal communications.' We took
      inspiration from Hobart, and the everyday experience of platforms like
      Slack, to imagine a variety of communications artifacts that bring the
      texture of these companies to life. These messages -generated both by
      humans and machines -are directed through private and public channels to
      diverse stakeholders. In aggregate, they convey the choices, practices, and
      culture that make up how each company operates.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What type of challenges does AI primarily present, according to
          leadership expert Ronald Heifetz?
        answer: AI primarily presents adaptive challenges, which are ambiguous, difficult
          to define, and require sophisticated leadership skills to navigate.
      - question: How does the text suggest addressing the challenges posed by AI
          in communications within companies?
        answer: The text suggests using storytelling to create a shared understanding
          of AI's adaptive challenges and imagining various communication artifacts,
          inspired by platforms like Slack, to convey company choices, practices,
          and culture.
      - question: What role does clarity and accuracy in internal communications play
          in the context of AI, as mentioned by tech blogger Byrne Hobart?
        answer: Byrne Hobart emphasizes that AI places a higher premium on clarity
          and accuracy in internal communications, which inspired the creation of
          diverse communication artifacts in the text.

      As you read along, you'll also notice that our companies still operate in a
      context with human messiness, resistance, and unpredictability. It's easy
      in depicting futures to ignore and smooth over such realities, what Nick
      Foster called 'The Future Mundane'. In our futures, just as today, things
      break, human tensions persist, and much of what surrounds us is not
      recently-invented and new.
      Speculations, like fictional companies and the future they inhabit, have a
      rich history, including at earlier points in the futures lineage of our own
      team, at Global Business Network, in Wired Magazine's 'Found Objects,' and
      at Shell Scenarios. But they work best when complemented with some
      analysis.
      So, each company's story concludes with a section, 'Unpacking This Future',
      that pulls together thematic highlights, explores the rationale of the
      storytelling, and calls out broader implications for business. If you
      prefer, you're welcome to switch the reading order and unpack each future
      before you jump into it.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the main focus of the companies' futures?
        answer: The main focus is on portraying the human messiness, resistance, and
          unpredictability that persist in these futures, rather than presenting an
          idealized, smooth version.
      - question: What is the purpose of the 'Unpacking This Future' section in each
          company's story?
        answer: The 'Unpacking This Future' section summarizes key themes, explains
          the reasoning behind the storytelling, and discusses broader business implications.
      - question: What is the suggested reading approach for the company's future
          stories?
        answer: Readers are given the option to either follow the narrative sequence
          or unpack each future's implications before diving into the story.

      A brief note on terminology: In our previous issue, we addressed the
      ongoing debate surrounding the term "agents" and its application in AI.
      Since that issue, AI agents have only become more mainstream. However,
      you'll observe that each fictional company uses different names for AI
      entities, reflecting their unique orientations and intentions.
      We're confident this issue will give you a richer understanding of AI
      agents at work in the near future. Bridging the imagination gap between
      present reality and potential futures is not easy, and not everything we
      discuss may ultimately come true. That's okay. Our goal is not perfect
      accuracy, but to catalyze better, more strategic conversations about the
      adaptive challenges AI agents will surface. So dive in and think hard about
      how your company might fare in these futures. (Hint, hint, the Closing
      gives you some pointers.)
      And, please, let us know your questions, objections, and most of all, the
      ideas and conversations this issue sparks.
      The Salesforce Futures Team
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the main focus of the Salesforce Futures issue?
        answer: The main focus is to provide a deeper understanding of AI agents and
          their potential impact on the future, aiming to stimulate strategic discussions
          about the challenges they may pose.
      - question: Why does the issue mention the varying names for AI entities
          used by fictional companies?
        answer: The issue highlights the diverse naming of AI entities to reflect
          each company's unique perspectives and objectives, emphasizing the adaptability
          of AI agents.
      - question: What is the ultimate goal of the Salesforce Futures Team in discussing
          AI agents?
        answer: The team's primary goal is not to ensure perfect accuracy but to encourage
          better, more strategic conversations about the adaptive challenges AI agents
          will bring.

      NEW FEATURE L A U N C H
      The winning feature this week comes from James Shin and our newest Vanner,
      Alejandra Coles. Alejandra and James cooked up a better interface for our
      automated inventory management system.
      - As before, they incorporate computer vision to help track and categorize
      items, but it just feels so much more intuitive. For example, there is a
      'Get rid of it' feature that allows customers to sell or donate items they
      don't want with the press of a button. 👉 Customers are going to love this
      and I anticipate interest from reselling platforms.
      Check it out. Run it through its paces. Talk to your customers and their
      agents. Share feedback. Iterate. Refine. Repeat.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who developed the new feature for the automated inventory management
          system?
        answer: The new feature was developed by James Shin and Alejandra Coles.
      - question: What is the purpose of the 'Get rid of it' feature in the updated
          inventory system?
        answer: The 'Get rid of it' feature allows customers to sell or donate items
          they no longer want with a single button press.
      - question: What is the suggested approach for gathering feedback on the new
          feature?
        answer: The suggested approach is to run the feature through its paces, talk
          to customers and their agents, and share feedback for iteration and refinement.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      - Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses machine learning techniques to
      find patterns within large data sets in order to recognize natural
      language. One application of NLP is sentiment analysis, where algorithms
      might look for patterns in social media posts to understand how customers
      feel about a specific brand or product.
      - Big Data is the raw fuel of AI - large amounts of structured or
      unstructured information that provide the inputs for surfacing patterns and
      making predictions.
      Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of billions of digitally connected
      devices, from toasters to cars to houses and jet engines, that collect and
      exchange data and can communicate with one another to better serve users.
      Predictive Analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that is used to make
      predictions about unknown future events, based on patterns in historical
      data. You might see this in marketing offers that become more relevant to
      you each time you take action (or don't) on an email offer.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is Natural Language Processing (NLP) and what is one of its
          applications?
        answer: NLP uses machine learning to find patterns in language data, and one
          application is sentiment analysis, which gauges public opinion from social
          media posts.
      - question: How does Big Data contribute to AI systems?
        answer: Big Data serves as the foundation for AI, providing vast structured
          or unstructured information that AI uses to identify patterns and make predictions.
      - question: What is the Internet of Things (IoT) and how does it function?
        answer: IoT is a vast interconnected network of devices, from home appliances
          to vehicles, that gather and share data, enabling them to communicate and
          enhance user experience.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      In the beginning, these were very simple problems. One of the earliest
      computing prototypes, sketched out by Belgian thinker Paul Otlet in 1934,
      'would allow people to search and browse through millions of interlinked
      documents, images, audio and video files,' according to The New York Times
      . It was an early vision of the internet with a poetic name: the
      'Mundaneum,' a means of storing and processing huge amounts of 'mundane'
      data. The premise of computing is to do what the human mind is designed not
      to do: remember every little detail, storing it so that every data point
      can be easily accessed when it's needed. (The human brain, by contrast, is
      designed to focus its processing power on what's important, as Nobel Prize-
      winning economist Daniel Kahneman explains in his book Thinking, Fast and
      Slow .)
      From the beginning, though, we dreamed of computers that could do more than
      the mundane. In 1956, Prof. John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial
      intelligence,' describing a world in which machines could 'solve the kinds
      of problems now reserved for humans.'
      But in order to move from simple computing to true AI, computers needed
      three things:
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was Paul Otlet's early computing prototype called and what
          was its purpose?
        answer: Paul Otlet's early computing prototype was called the 'Mundaneum,'
          which aimed to enable users to search and browse through millions of interlinked
          documents, images, audio, and video files.
      - question: How does the human brain's function contrast with the premise of
          computing, as described in the paragraph?
        answer: The human brain is designed to prioritize important information, while
          computing is intended to remember every detail and make it easily accessible.
      - question: When and by whom was the term 'artificial intelligence' coined,
          and what was its intended meaning?
        answer: In 1956, Prof. John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial intelligence,'
          envisioning machines capable of solving problems currently reserved for
          human intelligence.
