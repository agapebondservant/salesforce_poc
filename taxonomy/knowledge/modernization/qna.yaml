      What Is Artificial Intelligence?
      AI is often represented by various related terms:Â machine learning, deep
      learning, natural language processing, predictive analytics, and so on. All
      of these terms point to a future in which our platforms and systems are
      smart enough to learn from our interactions and data, not only to help us
      with what we ask, but also to anticipate our needs, taking care of mundane
      and forgotten tasks and reminding us of important ones. AI can connect the
      various nodes of our lives (home, work, travel) into one experience that
      moves seamlessly with us from house to car to office. Much of that
      experience comes through our phones. Within a few years, AI will be infused
      in everything digital.
      As consumers, we are already using AI without even realizing it. Google
      harnesses AI to autocomplete search queries, predicting what you are
      searching for with great accuracy and without human involvement. Facebook
      news feeds and Amazon product recommendations are tailored for you via
      machine-learning algorithms. Self-driving cars apply various AI techniques
      to avoid collisions and traffic congestion. All of these consumer apps have
      trained consumers to expect more from businesses: The new standard for
      every customer interaction is a smart, fast, seamless customer experience
      engagement.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are some subfields of Artificial Intelligence?
        answer: Some subfields of AI mentioned are machine learning, deep learning,
          and natural language processing.

      What Is Artificial Intelligence?
      At a high level, AI is both understanding historical data and applying what
      is learned to current contexts to make predictions. This has the potential
      to make every business 'smarter.'
      Today, every company faces an imperative to integrate AI into the fabric of
      their business in order to succeed. Until now, however, AI has largely been
      out of reach for businesses. The high cost to implement AI solutions,
      combined with a shortage of data scientists and incomplete data, has made
      it challenging for all but a few companies.
      That's where we come in. In 1999, Salesforce launched the first-ever cloud
      CRM platform, making customer relationship management accessible to
      businesses large and small. Since then, we've grown into a complete
      Customer Success Platform, with solutions across sales, service, marketing,
      community, analytics, commerce, IoT, and apps. Now, we're making our
      platform even smarter with Salesforce Einstein. Designed to enable
      companies large and small to be smarter and more predictive about their
      customers, Salesforce Einstein discovers insights, predicts outcomes,
      recommends next steps, and automates tasks for business users - all while
      getting smarter and smarter along the way.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the concept of having machines 'think
      like humans' - in other words, perform tasks like reasoning, planning,
      learning, and understanding language. While no one is expecting parity with
      human intelligence today or in the near future, AI has big implications in
      how we live our lives. The brains behind artificial intelligence is a
      technology called machine learning, which is designed to make our jobs
      easier and more productive.
      - Machine Learning is the core driver of AI, and involves computers
      learning from data with minimal programming. achieve the outcome on its own
      by feeding it data - for example, personalized recommendations on Amazon
      and Netflix. (Learn more here.) Machine learning is a broad term that
      encompasses related AI techniques, including:
      - Deep Learning which uses complex algorithms that mimic the brain's neural
      network to learn a domain recognition in photos.
      - Essentially, instead of programming rules for a machine, you program the
      desired outcome and train the machine to with little or no human
      supervision. Consumer apps like Google Photos use deep learning to power
      face
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and what are its implications?
        answer: AI is the concept of machines 'thinking like humans' by performing
          tasks such as reasoning, planning, learning, and understanding language.
          It has significant implications for our daily lives, though full human-like
          intelligence is not expected soon.
      - question: How does Machine Learning contribute to AI and what is its method?
        answer: Machine Learning is the core technology driving AI, enabling computers
          to learn from data with minimal programming. It achieves outcomes by being
          fed data, like personalized recommendations on platforms such as Amazon
          and Netflix.
      - question: What are Deep Learning and its application in AI?
        answer: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses complex algorithms
          to mimic the brain's neural networks for domain recognition, such as identifying
          objects in photos. Google Photos uses Deep Learning for its face recognition
          feature.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      - Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses machine learning techniques to
      find patterns within large data sets in order to recognize natural
      language. One application of NLP is sentiment analysis, where algorithms
      might look for patterns in social media posts to understand how customers
      feel about a specific brand or product.
      - Big Data is the raw fuel of AI - large amounts of structured or
      unstructured information that provide the inputs for surfacing patterns and
      making predictions.
      Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of billions of digitally connected
      devices, from toasters to cars to houses and jet engines, that collect and
      exchange data and can communicate with one another to better serve users.
      Predictive Analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that is used to make
      predictions about unknown future events, based on patterns in historical
      data. You might see this in marketing offers that become more relevant to
      you each time you take action (or don't) on an email offer.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      In the beginning, these were very simple problems. One of the earliest
      computing prototypes, sketched out by Belgian thinker Paul Otlet in 1934,
      'would allow people to search and browse through millions of interlinked
      documents, images, audio and video files,' according to The New York Times
      . It was an early vision of the internet with a poetic name: the
      'Mundaneum,' a means of storing and processing huge amounts of 'mundane'
      data. The premise of computing is to do what the human mind is designed not
      to do: remember every little detail, storing it so that every data point
      can be easily accessed when it's needed. (The human brain, by contrast, is
      designed to focus its processing power on what's important, as Nobel Prize-
      winning economist Daniel Kahneman explains in his book Thinking, Fast and
      Slow .)
      From the beginning, though, we dreamed of computers that could do more than
      the mundane. In 1956, Prof. John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial
      intelligence,' describing a world in which machines could 'solve the kinds
      of problems now reserved for humans.'
      But in order to move from simple computing to true AI, computers needed
      three things:
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was Paul Otlet's early computing prototype called and what
          was its purpose?
        answer: Paul Otlet's early computing prototype was called the 'Mundaneum,'
          which aimed to enable users to search and browse through millions of interlinked
          documents, images, audio, and video files.
      - question: How does the human brain's function contrast with the premise of
          computing, as described in the paragraph?
        answer: The human brain is designed to prioritize important information, while
          computing is intended to remember every detail and make it easily accessible.
      - question: When and by whom was the term 'artificial intelligence' coined,
          and what was its intended meaning?
        answer: In 1956, Prof. John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial intelligence,'
          envisioning machines capable of solving problems currently reserved for
          human intelligence.

      Here's a classic example. Let's say you want to train a machine to
      recognize pictures of cats.
      So you feed it two data points:
      It might conclude that a cat is a furry thing with pointy ears, almond-
      shaped eyes, whiskers, and paws. But what happens when it comes across this
      image?
      JStone / Shutterstock.com
      This is a cat, but without the telltale pointy ears or paws.
      Using only two images to 'teach' a machine how to identify a cat probably
      wouldn't equip that machine to accurately classify Garfield as such.
      However, feeding it billions of different images of cats - in nearly every
      color, size, and position possible - would make it much more likely to
      correctly classify an image like this:
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the initial problem with training a machine to recognize
          cats using only two data points?
        answer: The machine might only learn superficial features like fur, pointy
          ears, and paws, failing to recognize cats without those characteristics,
          like Garfield.
      - question: What could be done to improve a machine's ability to
          identify cats?
        answer: The machine should be trained with billions of diverse cat images,
          varying in color, size, and position, to enhance its recognition capabilities.
      - question: What makes the suggested method of training more effective for cat
          recognition?
        answer: This extensive training with numerous cat images ensures the machine
          can identify cats even if they lack certain typical features, like pointy
          ears or visible paws.

      Early data models lacked the volume of clean data required to perfect their
      data models and effectively 'learn.' Only recently, with the surge of data
      readily available via the internet, do the models have access to the data
      they need to get smarter. In 2009 , Stanford University computer scientist
      Andrew Ng and Google Fellow Jeff Dean led a Google research team to create
      a massive 'neural network' modeled after the human brain, comprising
      thousands of processors and more than 1 billion connections. Then, they fed
      the machine random images of cats, pulled from millions of online videos.
      By identifying commonalities and filtering the images through its brainlike
      neural network, the machine essentially taught itself how to identify an
      image of a cat. It was an astounding achievement for AI - and one that
      wouldn't have been possible just a few years earlier, without easy access
      to those millions of thumbnail images.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was the limitation faced by early data models?
        answer: Early data models lacked the volume of clean data required to perfect
          their models and effectively 'learn'.
      - question: When and by whom was a massive neural network created at Google?
        answer: In 2009, Stanford University computer scientist Andrew Ng and Google
          Fellow Jeff Dean led a Google research team to create this network.
      - question: How did the Google neural network learn to identify images of cats?
        answer: The machine was fed random images of cats from millions of online
          videos, identifying commonalities and teaching itself through its neural
          network.

      What AI Means for Business
      Remember how computers have gotten smaller and smarter? They've also gotten
      cheaper, resulting in a surge of smart devices that are generating a
      growing body of business data that, in turn, can power machine learning.
      The Internet of Things encompasses an entire world of digitally connected
      devices - toaster, toothbrushes, thermostats, lightbulbs, cars, and much
      more - that are now being networked, talking to each other, and businesses,
      and consumers. We're talking about a lot of connected things: 6 billion of
      them that, says Gartner, will be requesting support by 2018. Those billions
      of connected things mean huge volumes of customer data indeed, 90 percent
      of the world's data was created in the last 12 months alone.
      Businesses need to be smart about the way they gather, digest, and apply
      that data, which is the lifeblood of IoT - provided it can be properly
      used.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How has the development of computers impacted the rise of AI in
          business?
        answer: Computers have become smaller, smarter, and cheaper, leading to an
          increase in smart devices that generate vast amounts of business data, which
          is essential for powering machine learning and AI.
      - question: What is the Internet of Things (IoT) and how many connected devices
          are projected to need support by 2018 according to Gartner?
        answer: The Internet of Things refers to a network of digitally connected
          devices like home appliances, vehicles, etc., communicating with each other
          and businesses. Gartner predicted that around 6 billion of these connected
          devices would require support by 2018.
      - question: How significant is the data generated by IoT devices for businesses,
          and what percentage of the world's data was created in the last 12 months?
        answer: The data generated by IoT devices is crucial for businesses, constituting
          90% of the world's data, with the majority of it produced in the last 12
          months.

      What AI Means for Business
      But the impact of AI doesn't stop there. Behind each of those devices, of
      course, is a real customer - and the next generation of customers expects a
      cohesive, intelligent experience every time they interact with a business.
      When a delivery order is delayed, they expect to be contacted with an
      updated ETA and a make-good offer - such as a $5 credit or free shipping on
      their next order - without having to pick up the phone and talk to a
      service agent. AI makes it possible to create an entire universe of
      business apps to deliver smarter customer experiences across sales,
      service, and marketing interactions.
      For many businesses, however, AI has been largely out of reach.
      Historically, companies have faced four key challenges when it comes to
      adopting AI for business:
      - Data
      Expertise
      - Infrastructure
      - Context

      Below, we'll explore how companies can address each of these challenges in
      new ways.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What kind of customer experience does AI enable for businesses?
        answer: AI enables businesses to provide a cohesive, intelligent experience
          to customers, including automated updates and make-good offers for issues
          like delayed deliveries.
      - question: What are the main challenges businesses face when adopting AI?

      The Context Challenge
      For many businesses, AI may seem not only out of reach, but also
      irrelevant. Popular culture has imagined AI in the image of R2D2 and C3PO,
      rather than an essential component of modern business processes. Read on to
      learn more about our vision for how AI will transform sales, service,
      marketing, and IT by automating mundane tasks and empowering every human
      employee to add more value.
      AI for CRM: Everything You Need to Know
      The result of un-analyzed, underleveraged data isn't just missed
      opportunity. It's a significant failure to connect with modern consumers in
      the way they expect (and demand). Currently, half of all business decisions
      are made with incomplete information, which disconnects the business from
      the product and, therefore, from the customer. For all the data customers
      are creating, less than 1% is analyzed, such that 77% of customers say they
      are not engaged with businesses.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Why do some businesses view AI as irrelevant?
        answer: Some businesses view AI as irrelevant because popular culture has
          portrayed AI in a non-business context, like in Star Wars, and they may
          not see the immediate applicability of AI to their operations.
      - question: What is the consequence of not leveraging data effectively in business
          decisions?
        answer: The consequence of not leveraging data effectively is missed opportunities
          and a failure to connect with modern consumers, as half of business decisions
          are made with incomplete information, leading to a disconnect between the
          business and its customers.
      - question: What percentage of customer-generated data is currently being analyzed
          by businesses?
        answer: Less than 1% of the data customers generate is currently being analyzed
          by businesses, contributing to 77% of customers feeling unengaged with these
          companies.
