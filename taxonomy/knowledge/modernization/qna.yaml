      At Salesforce Futures, our mission requires us not only to anticipate,
      but also to imagine fleshed-out futures. This allows Salesforce and
      our customers to identify the choices they might need to make to shape
      their own destiny. Amara's law says that we overestimate the impact of
      technological change in the short-term and underestimate it in the
      long-term. When new technologies like generative AI are first
      introduced, we apply them narrowly to existing processes, and their
      impact can seem limited. It's only over a longer time-frame that
      innovators figure out how to use the capabilities of the new tech to
      redesign larger systems.
      To meet this challenge and bring possible futures to life where AI
      agents are fundamentally changing the shape of work, we use three
      fictional companies. They're at varying stages of AI transformation,
      and they operate differently, due to factors like their age, past
      strategic choices, and the intensity of competition they face. This
      reflects the reality we see in today's business world. For example,
      while a few organizations are aggressively preparing for an agent-
      driven future, others are just beginning their exploration.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the mission of Salesforce Futures?
        answer: The mission of Salesforce Futures is to anticipate and imagine detailed
          futures, enabling Salesforce and its customers to make informed choices
          about their future.
      - question: How does Amara's Law relate to the impact of new technologies like
          generative AI?
        answer: According to Amara's Law, new technologies like generative AI are
          initially underestimated in impact as they are applied narrowly to existing
          processes, but their true impact becomes apparent over a longer time-frame
          when innovators redesign larger systems using their capabilities.
      - question: How does Salesforce Futures illustrate the current business landscape
          regarding AI transformation?
        answer: Salesforce Futures uses three fictional companies at different stages
          of AI transformation to reflect today's business world, where some organizations
          are aggressively preparing for an agent-driven future, while others are
          just starting their exploration.

      In part this is because the challenges AI brings are not only -drawing
      on leadership expert Ronald Heifetz -technical ones, relatively easily
      defined and where expert knowledge exists on how to solve them.
      Rather, AI is generating more fundamental adaptive challenges,
      ambiguous and difficult to define, let alone to think about solving.
      Navigating adaptive challenges requires sophisticated leadership
      skills, and many pitfalls lie in wait along the way. Our storytelling
      aims to bridge the gap in imagination, creating a shared understanding
      that provides a basis for identifying adaptive challenges.
      Tech blogger Byrne Hobart has written of how AI 'places a much higher
      premium on clarity and accuracy in internal communications.' We took
      inspiration from Hobart, and the everyday experience of platforms like
      Slack, to imagine a variety of communications artifacts that bring the
      texture of these companies to life. These messages -generated both by
      humans and machines -are directed through private and public channels
      to diverse stakeholders. In aggregate, they convey the choices,
      practices, and culture that make up how each company operates.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What type of challenges does AI primarily present, according to
          the text?
        answer: AI primarily presents adaptive challenges, which are ambiguous, difficult
          to define, and require sophisticated leadership skills to navigate.
      - question: How does the text suggest addressing the adaptive challenges of
          AI?
        answer: The text suggests using storytelling to create a shared understanding
          and bridge the gap in imagination, providing a basis for identifying and
          addressing adaptive challenges.
      - question: What communication elements does the text reference as examples
          to illustrate company culture and operations?
        answer: The text references various communication artifacts, such as messages
          generated by both humans and machines, directed through private and public
          channels to diverse stakeholders, to convey a company's choices, practices,
          and culture.

      As you read along, you'll also notice that our companies still operate
      in a context with human messiness, resistance, and unpredictability.
      It's easy in depicting futures to ignore and smooth over such
      realities, what Nick Foster called 'The Future Mundane'. In our
      futures, just as today, things break, human tensions persist, and much
      of what surrounds us is not recently-invented and new.
      Speculations, like fictional companies and the future they inhabit,
      have a rich history, including at earlier points in the futures
      lineage of our own team, at Global Business Network, in Wired
      Magazine's 'Found Objects,' and at Shell Scenarios. But they work best
      when complemented with some analysis.
      So, each company's story concludes with a section, 'Unpacking This
      Future', that pulls together thematic highlights, explores the
      rationale of the storytelling, and calls out broader implications for
      business. If you prefer, you're welcome to switch the reading order
      and unpack each future before you jump into it.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the main focus of the companies' futures?
        answer: The main focus is on portraying the human messiness, resistance, and
          unpredictability that persist in these futures, rather than presenting an
          idealized, smooth version.
      - question: What is 'The Future Mundane' according to Nick Foster?
        answer: "'The Future Mundane' refers to the tendency in futuristic depictions
          to overlook and gloss over the realities of human imperfection, such as
          things breaking and ongoing tensions."
      - question: How are speculative company stories enhanced in Salesforce Futures?
        answer: Each company story is concluded with
          a section titled 'Unpacking This
          Future' that explores thematic highlights, rationale, and broader business
          implications.

      A brief note on terminology: In our previous issue, we addressed the
      ongoing debate surrounding the term "agents" and its application in
      AI. Since that issue, AI agents have only become more mainstream.
      However, you'll observe that each fictional company uses different
      names for AI entities, reflecting their unique orientations and
      intentions.
      We're confident this issue will give you a richer understanding of AI
      agents at work in the near future. Bridging the imagination gap
      between present reality and potential futures is not easy, and not
      everything we discuss may ultimately come true. That's okay. Our goal
      is not perfect accuracy, but to catalyze better, more strategic
      conversations about the adaptive challenges AI agents will surface. So
      dive in and think hard about how your company might fare in these
      futures. (Hint, hint, the Closing gives you some pointers.)
      And, please, let us know your questions, objections, and most of all,
      the ideas and conversations this issue sparks.
      The Salesforce Futures Team
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the main focus of the Salesforce Futures issue?
        answer: The main focus is to provide a deeper understanding of AI agents and
          their potential impact on the future, aiming to stimulate strategic discussions
          about the challenges they may pose.
      - question: Why does the paragraph mention the varying names for AI entities
          used by different companies?
        answer: The paragraph highlights the diverse naming of AI entities to reflect
          each company's unique perspectives and objectives in AI development.
      - question: What is the ultimate goal of the Salesforce Futures Team in discussing
          AI agents?
        answer: The team's primary goal is not to predict the future with absolute
          accuracy, but to encourage thoughtful conversations about the adaptive challenges
          AI agents might bring.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      - Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses machine learning techniques to
      find patterns within large data sets in order to recognize natural
      language. One application of NLP is sentiment analysis, where algorithms
      might look for patterns in social media posts to understand how customers
      feel about a specific brand or product.
      - Big Data is the raw fuel of AI - large amounts of structured or
      unstructured information that provide the inputs for surfacing patterns and
      making predictions.
      Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of billions of digitally connected
      devices, from toasters to cars to houses and jet engines, that collect and
      exchange data and can communicate with one another to better serve users.
      Predictive Analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that is used to make
      predictions about unknown future events, based on patterns in historical
      data. You might see this in marketing offers that become more relevant to
      you each time you take action (or don't) on an email offer.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is Natural Language Processing (NLP) and what is one of its
          applications?
        answer: NLP uses machine learning to find patterns in language data, and one
          application is sentiment analysis, which gauges public opinion from social
          media posts.
      - question: How does Big Data contribute to AI systems?
        answer: Big Data serves as the foundation for AI, providing vast structured
          or unstructured information that AI uses to identify patterns and make predictions.
      - question: What is the Internet of Things (IoT) and how does it function?
        answer: IoT is a vast interconnected network of devices, from home appliances
          to vehicles, that gather and share data, enabling them to communicate and
          enhance user experience.

      Glossary: How to Talk About AI
      In the beginning, these were very simple problems. One of the earliest
      computing prototypes, sketched out by Belgian thinker Paul Otlet in 1934,
      'would allow people to search and browse through millions of interlinked
      documents, images, audio and video files,' according to The New York Times
      . It was an early vision of the internet with a poetic name: the
      'Mundaneum,' a means of storing and processing huge amounts of 'mundane'
      data. The premise of computing is to do what the human mind is designed not
      to do: remember every little detail, storing it so that every data point
      can be easily accessed when it's needed. (The human brain, by contrast, is
      designed to focus its processing power on what's important, as Nobel Prize-
      winning economist Daniel Kahneman explains in his book Thinking, Fast and
      Slow .)
      From the beginning, though, we dreamed of computers that could do more than
      the mundane. In 1956, Prof. John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial
      intelligence,' describing a world in which machines could 'solve the kinds
      of problems now reserved for humans.'
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was Paul Otlet's early computing prototype called and what
          was its purpose?
        answer: Paul Otlet's early computing prototype was called the 'Mundaneum,'
          which aimed to enable users to search and browse through millions of interlinked
          documents, images, audio, and video files.
      - question: How does the human brain's function contrast with the premise of
          computing?
        answer: The human brain is designed to prioritize important information, while
          computing is intended to remember every detail and make it easily accessible.
      - question: When and by whom was the term 'artificial intelligence' coined,
          and what was its intended meaning?
        answer: In 1956, Prof. John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial intelligence,'
          envisioning machines capable of solving problems currently reserved for
          human intelligence.
